# Gradient-based dimension reduction for Bayesian inference

This repository studies parameter and data dimension reduction for Bayesian inference problems. We consider three applications: 

## Authors

Ricardo Baptista (MIT), Youssef Marzouk and Olivier Zahm
E-mails: rsb@mit.edu, ymarz@mit.edu

## Installation

The code is implemented in MATLAB and only requires the [ATM package](https://github.com/baptistar/ATM) to learn parametric transport maps that can perform the Bayesian inference step.
